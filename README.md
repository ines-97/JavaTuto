This project serves as a practical implementation of essential Java programming concepts, including:

* Scanners: Utilizing Scanner for user input and data handling.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Creating interactive applications using Java Swing.
* Random Functions: Generating random numbers and utilizing them in various scenarios.
* Arrays: Implementing single-dimensional arrays for data storage and manipulation.
* 2D Arrays: Working with multi-dimensional arrays for more complex data structures.
* Loops: Employing different loop constructs (for, while) to control program flow and iteration.
  
All this conseptions are seplified to the begginers and each ligne of code contains cvomments for more explainations.
